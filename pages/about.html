          <p class="about-paragraph">
            The Sixth City Dynasty Football League was founded in 2021 as a
            branch off of a standard redraft league with origins in the Sigma
            Phi Epsilon Ohio Zeta chapter. Rooted in Cleveland, Sixth City is
            host to members throughout the state of Ohio.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            Sixth City celebrates continuity and creativity. Franchises carry
            their own legacies from year to year, and they carry the glory and
            ignominy that comes with those legacies. Members concoct
            experimental formats like 2v2 Tag-Team and One-vs-Everyone matchups.
            History is preserved and celebrated with the advent of Throwback
            Week and the forthcoming SCDFL Hall of Fame.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            What began as a group of fraternity buddies coming together to enjoy
            the game of football has grown into a vibrant sports community,
            contributing to a league that has become an entire universe rich
            with history, rivalries, and traditions.
